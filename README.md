OJOGBONN Real Estate Website
Overview
The OJOGBONN Real Estate website is a responsive, mobile-first web application designed to help users find their ideal property. It features a clean and modern design with sections for property listings, frequently asked questions (FAQ), contact information, and social media links. The website is built using HTML and CSS, with a focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and user experience.
This project was developed as part of a coding exercise to demonstrate skills in front-end web development, including responsive design, CSS grid/flexbox layouts, and SVG integration for icons.
